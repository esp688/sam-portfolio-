<!-- article Introduction of myself -->
<p>
  I am Sammy, a professional with a dual expertise in product design and
  software development. My approach to problem-solving is centered on simplicity and efficiency.
  I firmly believe in utilizing user-centered design principles and making
  data-driven decisions in order to drive successful outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  With over a decade of experience in small business,
  I have experienced both success and setbacks, accomplished dreams and lost opportunities.
  Through it all, the most crucial lesson I have learned is the significance of
  fostering empathy and promoting collaboration within my team to
  continuously move forward and overcome challenges.
